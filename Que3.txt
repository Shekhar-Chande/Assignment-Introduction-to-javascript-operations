Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Ans:-  Unary operators are the simplest of the three categories of JavaScript operators. They operate on a single operand, which is a variable or a value. You can use unary operators to increment or decrement a variable, change the sign of a number, or perform logical negation.


Examples of Unary Operators

Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators: Use these operators to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.

let x = 5;
x++; // Increment x by 1, now x is 6
x--; // Decrement x by 1, now x is 5 again


Logical negation (!) operator: Use this operator to reverse the logical value of a boolean expression.

let isTrue = true;
let notTrue = !isTrue;  // notTrue is now false


Unary minus (-) operator: This operator changes the sign of a numerical value.
let y = 10;

let negY = -y; // negY is -10;





Binary Operators in JavaScript

Binary operators take two operands, which can be variables, values, or expressions, and they perform operations on them. You can use binary operators for arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations.


Examples of Binary Operators

Addition (+) operator: Adds two numerical values together.
let sum = 3 + 4; // sum is 7


Multiplication (*) operator: Multiplies two numerical values.
let product = 5 * 6; // product is 30


Equality (==) operator: Compares two values for equality.
let isEqual = (x == y);
// isEqual is false (assuming x and y are different)





The Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a conditional that takes three operands: a condition, a value if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false.



let age = 20;
let status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
