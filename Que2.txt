Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category?

Ans:- Javascript operators can be classified into different categories based on their functionality, such as Arithmetic operators, Assignment operators, Comparison operators, Logical operators, Bitwise operators, and more.


1. Arithmetic operators :-  +, -, /, *, %, ++, --

let x = 5;

// addition operator
console.log("Addition: x + 3 = ", x + 3);

// subtraction operator
console.log("Subtraction: x - 3 =", x - 3);

// multiplication operator
console.log("Multiplication: x * 3 =", x * 3);

// division operator
console.log("Division: x / 3 =", x / 3);

// remainder operator
console.log("Remainder: x % 3 =", x % 3);

// increment operator
console.log("Increment: ++x =", ++x);

// decrement operator
console.log("Decrement: --x =", --x);

// exponentiation operator
console.log("Exponentiation: x ** 3 =", x ** 3);




2.  Assignment operators

=	Assignment Operator	
+=	Addition Assignment	
-=	Subtraction Assignment	
*=	Multiplication Assignment	
/=	Division Assignment	
%=	Remainder Assignment	
**=	Exponentiation Assignment	


let a = 7;
console.log("Assignment: a = 7, a =", a);

// addition assignment operator
a += 5;  // a = a + 5
console.log("Addition Assignment: a += 5, a =", a);

// subtraction assignment operator
a -= 5;  // a = a - 5
console.log("Subtraction Assignment: a -= 5, a =", a);

// multiplication assignment operator
a *= 2;  // a = a * 2
console.log("Multiplication Assignment: a *= 2, a =", a);

// division assignment operator
a /= 2;  // a = a / 2
console.log("Division Assignment: a /= 2, a =", a);

// remainder assignment operator
a %= 2;  // a = a % 2
console.log("Remainder Assignment: a %= 2, a =", a);

// exponentiation assignment operator
a **= 2;  // a = a**2
console.log("Exponentiation Assignment: a **= 7, a =", a)





3. Comparison operators

==	Equal to	
!=	Not equal to	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal to	
<=	Less than or equal to	
===	Strictly equal to	
!==	Strictly not equal to



// equal to operator
console.log("Equal to: 2 == 2 is", 2 == 2);

// not equal operator
console.log("Not equal to: 3 != 3 is", 3 != 3);

// strictly equal to operator
console.log("Strictly equal to: 2 === '2' is", 2 === '2');

// strictly not equal to operator
console.log("Strictly not equal to: 2 !== '2' is", 2 !== '2');

// greater than operator
console.log("Greater than: 3 > 3 is", 3 > 3);

// less than operator
console.log("Less than: 2 > 2 is", 2 > 2);

// greater than or equal to operator
console.log("Greater than or equal to: 3 >= 3 is", 3 >= 3);

// less than or equal to operator
console.log("Less than or equal to: 2 <= 2 is", 2 <= 2);




4. Logical operators

&& (Logical AND)	
|| (Logical OR)	
! (Logical NOT)	




let x = 3;

// logical AND
console.log((x < 5) && (x > 0));  // true
console.log((x < 5) && (x > 6));  // false

// logical OR
console.log((x > 2) || (x > 5));  // true
console.log((x > 3) || (x < 0));  // false

// logical NOT
console.log(!(x == 3));  // false
console.log(!(x < 2));  // true
